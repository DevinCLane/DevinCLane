### Devin C. Lane

Hello! 

  I'm a creative software engineer adept at delivering impactful solutions through cross-functional collaborations. My background in music, writing, and education gives me a unique perspective and ability to empathize with users, leading to intuitive and easy-to-use designs.

  These experiences translate in to results: for example, winning Google's BitRate hackathon in 2020 for our team's generative text-to-music AI web application, [DearDiary.ai](https://deardiary.ai/).

Areas of expertise include:
- Full-stack development using JavaScript, React, Node, Express, MongoDB, HTML, and CSS.
- Marketing and writing skills including content strategy, technical writing, and editing.
- Music and audio production, mixing, and editing using Logic, Max/MSP, and Final Cut.
- Curriculum design and instruction for lesson and course development.
- Strong fluency in Spanish and functional knowledge of Portuguese.
- High emotional intelligence and excellent verbal and written communication skills.
- Strong organizational skills, both individually and as a team member.
