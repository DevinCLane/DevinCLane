### Devin C. Lane

Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a creative software engineer adept at delivering impactful solutions through cross-functional collaborations.

My background in music, writing, and education informs a unique perspective and a clear, empathetic communication and leadership style.

These experiences translate in to results: for example, winning Google's BitRate hackathon in 2020 for our team's generative text-to-music AI web application, [DearDiary.ai](https://deardiary.ai/).
